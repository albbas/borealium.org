The Borealium web site is a central place to access language technology tools for the smaller languages of the Nordic countries, from Icelandic and down in speaker population size, all the way down to Pite and Ume Sámi.

The development of the site was financed by Nordisk ministerråd. The initiative to making the site was taken by ASTIN. Maintenance and administration is handled by Divvun and Giellatekno at UiT The Arctic University of Norway.
